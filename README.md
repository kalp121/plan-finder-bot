# Plan Finder Robot

###### Introduction
In a square grid full of books and it's corresponding basckets at random places
a robot tries to find an optimal plan to reach the goal state. Here Goal state would be that 
all the books are in their corresponding basckets and no book is on the floor.

-This script is written for ROS environment using catkin workspace.
-Due to high number of dependancies along folder structure I have uploaded
 Only python script (refinement.py) which contains execution of the plan generated by PDDL scripts.
-Domain.pddl and Problem.pddl files are used to create a solution plan.I used Fast Forward(FF) Planner 
 to create a solution plan.
